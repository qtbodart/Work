/**
 * We are interested in solving a maze represented
 * by a matrix of integers 0-1 of size nxm.
 * This matrix is a two-dimensional array.
 * An entry equal to '1' means that there
 * is a wall and therefore this position is not accessible,
 * while '0' means that the position is free.
 * We ask you to write a Java code to discover
 * the shortest path between two coordinates
 * on this matrix from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
 * The moves can only be vertical (up/down) or horizontal (left/right)
 * (not diagonal), one step at a time.
 * The result of the path is an Iterable of
 * coordinates from the origin to the destination.
 * These coordinates are represented by integers
 * between 0 and n * m-1, where an integer 'a'
 * represents the position x =a/m and y=a%m.
 * If the start or end position is a wall
 * or if there is no path, an empty Iterable must be returned.
 * The same applies if there is no path
 * between the origin and the destination.
