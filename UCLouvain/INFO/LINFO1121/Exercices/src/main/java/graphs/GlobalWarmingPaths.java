/**

 * Assume the following 5x5 matrix that represent a grid surface:
 * int [][] tab = new int[][] {{1,3,3,1,3},
 *                             {4,2,2,4,5},
 *                             {4,4,5,4,2},
 *                             {1,4,2,3,6},
 *                             {1,1,1,6,3}};
 *
 * Given a global water level, all positions in the matrix
 * with a value <= the water level are flooded and therefore unsafe.
 * So, assuming the water level is 3,
 * all safe points are highlighted between parenthesis:
 *
 *   1 , 3 , 3 , 1 , 3
 *  (4), 2 , 2 ,(4),(5)
 *  (4),(4),(5),(4), 2
 *   1 ,(4), 2 , 3 ,(6)
 *   1 , 1 , 1 ,(6), 3}
 *
 * The method you need to implement is
 * a method that find a safe-path between
 * two positions (row,column) on the matrix.
 * The path assume you only make horizontal or vertical moves
 * but not diagonal moves.
 *
 * For a water level of 4, the shortest path
 * between (1,0) and (1,3) is
 * (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,3)
 *
 *
 * Complete the code below so that the {@code  shortestPath} method
 * works as expected
