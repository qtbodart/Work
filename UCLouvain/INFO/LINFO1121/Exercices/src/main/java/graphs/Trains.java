/**
 * Considering a list containing the relations between train stations
 * (a train leaves the station `from` at `startTime`
 * and arrives at station `to` at `endTime`) and the positions
 * of those stations, a starting station and a starting time,
 * what is the earliest hour at which you can reach each an accessible station ?
 * <p>
 * You don't have to consider several points :
 * - passengers can leave a station at the exact moment where they reach this station
 * - all liaisons are direct
 * - timetable are not periodic, you don't have to repeat them evryday
 * - startTime < endTime and from != to are always true in all relations
 * - there is no duplicate entry (i.e. strictly equal relations)
 * <p>
 * As an example, let's consider that your list of relations between train stations is :
 * {(Bxl-midi, 9:00 am) : [(Namur, 9:20 am), (Charleroi, 9:30 am), (Ottiginies, 9:20 am)],
 * (Ottignies, 9:30 am) : [(LLN, 9:40 am), (Charleroi, 9:50) am],
 * (Charleroi, 9:30 am) : [(Namur, 9:45 am)],
 * (Charleroi, 9:50 am) : [(Ottignies, 10:00 am)],
 * (Namur, 10:00 am) : [(Charleroi, 10:30 am)],
 * (Ottignies, 10:00 am) : [(LLN, 10:20 am)]
 * }
 * <p>
 * In the above dictionary, the keys are the departure stations and times,
 * and the values are a list of stations that you can reach
 * (if you take a train starting from the key) and the time
 * at which you would reach them.
 * <p>
 * The list of reacheable stations and the earliest hour you can reach them is :
 * {Bxl-midi : 9:00 am,
 * Namur : 9:20 am,
 * Charleroi, 9:30 am,
 * Ottignies : 9:20 am,
 * LLN : 9:40 am
 * }
 * <p>
 * We leave notion of optimal/reasonable complexity unclear on purpose.
 * It is your job, based on your knowledge,
 * to identify, among the appropriate algorithm family, which one is optimal.
 * <p>
 * Some clues :
 * - As you probably guessed it, it is clearly a graph problem.
 *   But it isn't a usual graph since nodes are particular.
 *   Nodes don't represent only a point in the space, but also
 *   a point in the time (for example (Bruxelles-midi, 8:48 am)).
 * - Don't forget that if I reach Bxl-midi at time i,
 *   I can take any train that leaves Bxl-midi at time j >= i.
 * - Consider the function TreeMap.subMap that might be useful
 *   (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html#subMap-K-boolean-K-boolean-) ?
