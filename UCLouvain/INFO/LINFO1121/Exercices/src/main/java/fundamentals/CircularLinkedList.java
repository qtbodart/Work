/**
 * Author Pierre Schaus
 *
 * We are interested in the implementation of a circular simply linked list,
 * i.e. a list for which the last position of the list refers, as the next position,
 * to the first position of the list.
 *
 * The addition of a new element (enqueue method) is done at the end of the list and
 * the removal (remove method) is done at a particular index of the list.
 *
 * A (single) reference to the end of the list (last) is necessary to perform all operations on this queue.
 *
 * You are therefore asked to implement this circular simply linked list by completing the class see (TODO's)
 * Most important methods are:
 *
 * - the enqueue to add an element;
 * - the remove method [The exception IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when the index value is not between 0 and size()-1];
 * - the iterator (ListIterator) used to browse the list in FIFO.
 *
 * @param <Item>
